civic isues is a web-based civic issue management platform that connects citizens and city administrators to report, track, and resolve public issues efficiently.

it’s like a “bridge” between the people and the authorities — think of it as a mini digital municipality.

citizens can report problems (like garbage, potholes, broken lights, etc.), attach a photo and location, and the admin updates its status to pending / resolved.
